# Requirements Document

## Introduction

このAPIサーバーは、FastAPIフレームワークを使用してRESTful APIを提供するPythonベースのWebサーバーです。uvをパッケージマネージャとして使用し、PostgreSQLデータベースとSQLModel ORMを活用してデータ永続化を行います。モダンなPython開発のベストプラクティスに従って構築され、FastAPIの高性能で自動ドキュメント生成機能を活用し、拡張可能なAPIエンドポイントを提供し、適切なエラーハンドリング、認証、ログ機能を備えます。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a FastAPI server project with uv package management, so that I can efficiently manage dependencies and maintain a clean development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a proper uv project structure with pyproject.toml
2. WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL use uv to manage FastAPI and related package installations
3. WHEN the project is set up THEN the system SHALL include development dependencies for testing, Ruff for linting and formatting, and FastAPI development tools
4. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL provide automatic API documentation via FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to interact with RESTful API endpoints, so that I can perform CRUD operations on resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/health THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status with health information
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/posts THEN the system SHALL return a list of posts in JSON format
3. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/posts with valid data THEN the system SHALL create a new post and return 201 status
4. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/posts/{id} THEN the system SHALL return the specific post or 404 if not found
5. WHEN a PUT request is made to /api/posts/{id} with valid data THEN the system SHALL update the post and return 200 status
6. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /api/posts/{id} THEN the system SHALL remove the post and return 204 status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the API server effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid request is received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500, etc.)
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp and relevant context
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error messages in JSON format
4. WHEN an unhandled exception occurs THEN the system SHALL return a 500 status with a generic error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want input validation and data serialization with database integration, so that the API handles data safely and consistently with persistent storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN request data is received THEN the system SHALL validate input against SQLModel schemas
2. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with validation error details
3. WHEN data is returned THEN the system SHALL serialize responses consistently in JSON format using SQLModel
4. WHEN optional fields are provided THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately
5. WHEN data is persisted THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL database through SQLModel ORM
6. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL handle connection pooling and transactions properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migration and schema management, so that I can maintain database structure changes over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL create database tables based on SQLModel definitions
2. WHEN schema changes are made THEN the system SHALL support database migrations
3. WHEN connecting to database THEN the system SHALL use proper connection configuration from environment variables
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle database errors gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API server to be testable and maintainable, so that I can ensure code quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests for all API endpoints
2. WHEN integration tests are run THEN the system SHALL test database operations with a test database
3. WHEN the code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL pass Ruff linting and formatting checks, and type checking
4. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL use comprehensive type hints for all variables and functions
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL be configurable through environment variables
6. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debug information
